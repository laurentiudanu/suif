What defines a good design
- simple and natural dialogue (speaking the users language not the designer, programmer or computer language)
- minimize the user's memory load (it's natural for humans to forget)
- use constructive error messages
- make clear call to actions and exits
- give feedback for actions
- preventing analysis paralysis by setting a finite number of choices in small iterative steps (design based on clear objectives and priorities - don't overthink, keep it as simple as possible)

Digital design is not a coin flipping pseudoscience or a math problem with one correct answer because it's more than aesthetics, typefaces or grids. Digital design is crafting a thoughtful interface, delivering a meaningful experience for the user and driving measurable results.
